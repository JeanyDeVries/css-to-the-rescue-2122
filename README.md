# CSS to the Rescue ~ DJ Control Panel

# Concept
The concept is to make a interactivee DJ control panel which interacts with the crowd. The interactions are handled by buttons and sliders. 
Interaction ideas:
- Crowd that dances upwards
- Light brighten up
- Set music louder with a slider (sounds a slider are both made with javascript)
- Discoballs moves or lightens up
- Off switch
- Maybe move the circle pads
- Add some fun sounds to some buttons

I also want to implement some small details if I have the time. 
Detail ideas:
- Cursor is a headset or some other icon
